# SteelBuild Pro

SteelBuild Pro is a standalone project management application for
structural steel fabrication and erection projects.

This repository is no longer dependent on Base44 services.
All backend logic, data, and lifecycle enforcement will be implemented
and maintained within this codebase.

## Core Principles
- Work Packages drive all scheduling and automation
- Fabrication → Delivery → Erection is strictly enforced
- Downstream tasks are system-generated, not user-created
- The system prevents invalid actions instead of warning about them

## Status
Standalone rebuild in progress.
